# Graph-Backed Assets

[Basic software-defined assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#a-basic-software-defined-asset) are computed using a single op. If generating an asset involves multiple discrete computations, you can use graph-backed assets by separating each computation into an op and assembling them into an op graph to combine your computations. This allows you to launch re-executions of runs at the op boundaries, but doesn't require you to link each intermediate value to an asset in persistent storage.

## Defining graph-backed assets

To define a graph-backed asset, use the <PyObject object="graph_asset" decorator /> decorator. The decorated function defines the dependencies between a set of ops, which are combined to compute the asset.

In this case, when you tell Dagster to materialize the `slack_files_table` asset, Dagster will invoke `fetch_files_from_slack` and then invoke `store_files` after `fetch_files_from_slack` has completed.

```python file=/concepts/assets/graph_backed_asset.py startafter=start example endbefore=end example
import pandas as pd
from dagster import graph_asset, op
from dagster_slack import SlackResource


@op
def fetch_files_from_slack(slack: SlackResource) -> pd.DataFrame:
    files = slack.get_client().files_list(channel="#random")
    return pd.DataFrame(
        [
            {
                "id": file.get("id"),
                "created": file.get("created"),
                "title": file.get("title"),
                "permalink": file.get("permalink"),
            }
            for file in files
        ]
    )


@op
def store_files(files):
    return files.to_sql(name="slack_files", con=create_db_connection())


@graph_asset
def slack_files_table():
    return store_files(fetch_files_from_slack())
```

### Defining managed-loading dependencies for graph-backed assets

Similar to software-defined assets, Dagster infers the upstream assets from the names of the arguments to the decorated function. Dagster will then delegate loading the data to an [I/O manager](/concepts/io-management/io-managers).

The example below includes an asset named `middle_asset`. `middle_asset` depends on `upstream_asset`, and `downstream_asset` depends on `middle_asset`:

```python file=/concepts/assets/graph_backed_asset.py startafter=start_basic_dependencies endbefore=end_basic_dependencies
from dagster import asset, graph_asset, op


@asset
def upstream_asset():
    return 1


@op
def add_one(input_num):
    return input_num + 1


@op
def multiply_by_two(input_num):
    return input_num * 2


@graph_asset
def middle_asset(upstream_asset):
    return multiply_by_two(add_one(upstream_asset))


@asset
def downstream_asset(middle_asset):
    return middle_asset + 7
```

### Graph-backed multi-assets

Using the <PyObject object="graph_multi_asset" decorator />, you can create a combined definition of multiple assets that are computed using the same graph of ops and same upstream assets.

In the below example, `two_assets` accepts `upstream_asset` and outputs two assets, `first_asset` and `second_asset`:

```python file=/concepts/assets/graph_backed_asset.py startafter=start_basic_dependencies_2 endbefore=end_basic_dependencies_2
from dagster import AssetOut, graph_multi_asset


@graph_multi_asset(outs={"first_asset": AssetOut(), "second_asset": AssetOut()})
def two_assets(upstream_asset):
    one, two = two_outputs(upstream_asset)
    return {"first_asset": one, "second_asset": two}
```

### Advanced: Subsetting graph-backed assets

By default, when executing a graph-backed asset, every asset produced by the graph must be materialized. This means that attempting to selectively execute a subset of assets defined in the graph-backed asset will result in an error.

If the underlying computation is sufficiently flexible to selectively output a subset of assets, a graph-backed asset can be subsetted. For example, let’s say we wanted to define a graph-backed asset with the structure depicted in the image below. In this case, we want to independently materialize `foo_asset` and `baz_asset`.

<center>
  <Image
    alt="Graph-backed asset"
    src="/images/concepts/assets/graph-backed-asset.png"
    width={833}
    height={621}
  />
</center>

In order to selectively output an asset from a graph-backed asset, Dagster will run each op that is a dependency of the outputted asset. In the example, if we wanted to selectively materialize `foo_asset`, Dagster would run `foo` and `bar`. If we wanted to selectively materialize `baz_asset`, Dagster would run all three ops (`foo`, `bar`, and `baz`).

Because the `foo` op yields an asset output (`foo_asset`) and is an upstream dependency of another asset generated from the graph (`baz_asset`), we need to structure `foo` to selectively return outputs depending on the asset subset selected for execution. We can do this by defining `foo` to have optional outputs that are yielded conditionally. Dagster provides a `context.selected_output_names` object on the op context that will return the outputs necessary to generate the asset subset.

During execution, if we select just `baz_asset` for materialization, the below implementation of `foo` will return `{"foo_2"}` for `context.selected_output_names`, preventing `foo_asset` from being materialized.

```python file=/concepts/assets/subset_graph_backed_asset.py startafter=start_graph_backed_asset_foo endbefore=end_graph_backed_asset_foo
@op(out={"foo_1": Out(is_required=False), "foo_2": Out(is_required=False)})
def foo(context: OpExecutionContext, bar_1):
    # Selectively returns outputs based on selected assets
    if "foo_1" in context.selected_output_names:
        yield Output(bar_1 + 1, output_name="foo_1")
    if "foo_2" in context.selected_output_names:
        yield Output(bar_1 + 2, output_name="foo_2")
```

Because Dagster flattens each op graph into a flat input/output mapping between ops under the hood, any op that produces an output of the graph must be structured to yield its outputs optionally, enabling the outputs to be returned independently.

In the example, `foo` and `baz` produce outputs of `my_graph`. Subsequently, their outputs need to be yielded optionally. Because `foo` yields multiple outputs, we must structure our code to conditionally yield its outputs like in the code snippet above.

However, because `baz` only yields a singular output, Dagster will only run `baz` when its asset output `baz_asset` is selected. So, we don’t have to structure `baz` to return an optional output. Because `bar` does not yield any outputs that are returned from `my_graph`, its outputs do not have to be selectively returned.

We could define the asset using the code below. Notice that `can_subset` must be set to `True` in the asset definition to signify that the graph-backed asset can be subsetted.

```python file=/concepts/assets/subset_graph_backed_asset.py startafter=start_graph_backed_asset_example endbefore=end_graph_backed_asset_example
@op(out={"bar_1": Out(), "bar_2": Out()})
def bar():
    return 1, 2


@op
def baz(foo_2, bar_2):
    return foo_2 + bar_2


@graph_multi_asset(
    outs={"foo_asset": AssetOut(), "baz_asset": AssetOut()}, can_subset=True
)
def my_graph_assets():
    bar_1, bar_2 = bar()
    foo_1, foo_2 = foo(bar_1)
    return {"foo_asset": foo_1, "baz_asset": baz(foo_2, bar_2)}


defs = Definitions(assets=[my_graph_assets], jobs=[define_asset_job("graph_asset")])
```

Depending on how outputs are returned from the ops within a graph-backed asset, there could be unexpected materializations. For example, the following `foo` implementation would unexpectedly materialize `foo_asset` if `baz_asset` was the only asset selected for execution.

```python file=/concepts/assets/subset_graph_backed_asset_unexpected_materializations.py startafter=start_unexpected_materialization_foo endbefore=end_unexpected_materialization_foo
@op(out={"foo_1": Out(), "foo_2": Out()})
def foo():
    return 1, 2


# Will unexpectedly materialize foo_asset
defs.get_job_def("my_graph_assets").execute_in_process(
    asset_selection=[AssetKey("baz_asset")]
)
```

This is because the `foo` op is an upstream dependency of `baz_asset`, and this implementation of `foo` returns both the `foo_1` and `foo_2` outputs. The `foo_1` output is returned as the `foo_asset` output of the graph, causing an unexpected materialization of `foo_asset`.

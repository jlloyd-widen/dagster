# Integrating external metrics into Dagster Cloud Insights (Experimental)

<Note>
  This feature is considered <strong>experimental</strong>.
</Note>

External metrics, such as Snowflake credits, can be integrated into the Dagster Insights UI. The [`dagster-cloud`](https://pypi.org/project/dagster-cloud/) package contains utilities for capturing and submitting external metrics about data operations to Dagster Cloud via an API.

---

## Limitations

Before you start, note that:

- This is a Dagster Cloud Enterprise feature
- Up to two million individual data points may be added to Insights, per month
- External metrics data will only be retained for 90 days

---

## Supported integrations

Currently, Insights supports integrating Snowflake metrics for:

- **Usage generated by queries made to Snowflake resources.** Refer to the [Integrating direct Snowflake usage with Dagster Cloud Insights guide](/dagster-cloud/insights/integrating-snowflake) for more info.
- **Snowflake usage generated by dbt.** Refer to the [dbt + Snowflake + Dagster Cloud Insights guide](/dagster-cloud/insights/integrating-snowflake-and-dbt) for more info.
